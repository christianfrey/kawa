# Kawa

Kawa is a small macOS menu bar app that keeps your Mac awake using system power management.  

- Toggle sleep prevention directly from the menu bar.
- Doesn't use the the built-in `caffeinate` command.
- Prevents sleep when lid is closed (optional) - works exactly like Amphetamine.
- Launch at login option.
- Shows notifications when activated/deactivated.
- Minimal, lightweight, and built with SwiftUI.
